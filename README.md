I have just edited some fonts so that your mirror bot can look cool.

Deployment Method :-
1. Fork / Template my repo.
2. Rename config_sample.env to config.env and then add the vars u need in config.env.
3. Upload token.pickle / accounts directory / credentials.json in heroku branch (token and credentials is must without these uploading to gdrive won't work)
4. Go to Actions tab and then run the workflow (heroku one).
5. If you see Info - Bot Sarted !!! Message in your heroku logs it means bot successfully deployed.



NOTE - I am just changing some string values which won't give any errors during the working of the mirror bot. So, if u face any error regarding this please contact the support group od the original repo.
